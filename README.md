## AlkeParking
AlkeParking is a parking lot that allows four types of vehicles (car, motorcycle, minibus and bus)
and has a maximum capacity of up to 20 parked vehicles.

## Funcionalidades:
- Add vehicle to the parking lot by entering the license plate number from an Options Menu on the console;
- Inform discount coupon, if any, to reduce the total fare by 15%;
- Remove vehicle from the parking lot and inform the total amount of the fee to be paid;
- List the list of license plates of vehicles that are parked at the moment;
- List the total number of vehicles that were removed from the parking lot;
- List the values received from all vehicles that have been parked.

## Fee

Each type of vehicle has a specific fixed rate, as shown in the table below:

| Type of vehicles   | Fee |
| ------------------ |----:|
| Car                | $20 |
| Motorcycle         | $15 |
| Minibus            | $25 |
| Bus                | $30 |

After the first 2 hours, there will be a variable rate where you will be charged $5 for every 15 minutes exceeded, regardless of the type of vehicle.
